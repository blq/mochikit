usage: Generates out a Closure deps.js file given a list of JavaScript sources.

Paths can be specified as arguments or (more commonly) specifying trees
with the flags (call with --help for descriptions).

Usage: depswriter.py [path/to/js1.js [path/to/js2.js] ...]


options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output_file=OUTPUT_FILE
                        If specified, write output to this path instead of
                        writing to standard output.
  --root=ROOTS          A root directory to scan for JS source files. Paths of
                        JS files in generated deps file will be relative to
                        this path.  This flag may be specified multiple times.
  --root_with_prefix=ROOTS_WITH_PREFIX
                        A root directory to scan for JS source files, plus a
                        prefix (if either contains a space, surround with
                        quotes).  Paths in generated deps file will be
                        relative to the root, but preceeded by the prefix.
                        This flag may be specified multiple times.
  --path_with_depspath=PATHS_WITH_DEPSPATH
                        A path to a source file and an alternate path to the
                        file in the generated deps file (if either contains a
                        space, surround with whitespace). This flag may be
                        specifified multiple times.
